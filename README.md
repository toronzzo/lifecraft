pip install pygame

when you press P there the person around kills in a radius of 1 cell

when you press C in the console it shows what unit you want to create

then left-click on any cell

when you press S you save

on L you load

and then the unit you selected through the console appears there

and also

you move with the arrows
and enter is like the next move

there is a comment in the code,

I haven't figured out how to add pictures in paygame so that they are glued to these units.
